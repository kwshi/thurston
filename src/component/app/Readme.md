Thurston's conjecture intro.

$$hi$$

Riemann's mapping theorem states the following. Suppose $U$ is a non-empty, proper open subset of $ℂ$ and that $U$ is simply-connected, and let $z₀,z₁∈U$. Then there exists a biholomorphism $ϕ\colon U→𝔻$ (where $𝔻$ is the unit disk), with the property that $ϕ(z₀)=0$, and $ϕ(z₁)$ lands on the positive-real axis.

Thurston's conjecture (also sometimes known as the _discrete Riemann mapping theorem_) provides an insightful (and pretty!) way to construct and visualize the Riemann mapping theorem. Loosely stated, the method proceeds as follows:

1. Given $U$, approximately triangulate $U$ via a hexagonal circle-packing of radius $ϵ$.
2. Carefully resize each circle in the packing (keeping the tangency structure the same) until the packing fits “maximally” within the unit disk; i.e., boundary circles end up tangent to the boundary of the disk.
3. This resizing results in a mapping from (the centers of) circles in the original domain to (the centers of) circles in the unit disk.
